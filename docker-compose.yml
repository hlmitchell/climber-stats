# This docker-compose.yml file tells Docker to do the following:

# Pull the speicified image from the registry.

# Run 5 instances of that image as a service called web, limiting each one to use, at most, 10% of the CPU (across all cores), and 50MB of RAM.

# Immediately restart containers if one fails.

# Map port 3000 on the host to web’s port 8080.

# Instruct web’s containers to share port 8080 via a load-balanced network called webnet. (Internally, the containers themselves publish to web’s port 80 at an ephemeral port.)

# Define the webnet network with the default settings (which is a load-balanced overlay network).
